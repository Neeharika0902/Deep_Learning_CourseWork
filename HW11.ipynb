            "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a new paradigm to address weaknesses in traditional networks by separating the control plane from the data plane. However, SDN architecture is vulnerable to various attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt network resources. Current intrusion detection methods using Machine Learning (ML) in SDN networks face limitations due to outdated datasets lacking in attack diversity. This paper introduces DDoSNet, an intrusion detection system based on Deep Learning (DL) utilizing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with autoencoder. Evaluation using the CICDDoS2019 dataset demonstrates improved attack detection compared to standard methods, enhancing network security.\n",
            "\n",
            "Introduction:\n",
            "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) revolutionizes network management by centralizing control and separating it from data transmission, leading to increased reliability. However, SDN is susceptible to new security vulnerabilities and attacks, including DDoS attacks, which can overwhelm network resources. DDoS attacks pose significant threats and are challenging to detect, especially in SDN environments. Traditional Machine Learning methods for intrusion detection lack effectiveness due to outdated datasets and limited attack diversity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes DDoSNet, a DL-based model for enhanced DDoS attack detection in SDN networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Methodology:\n",
            "DDoSNet combines RNN with autoencoder to extract features from network traffic data. The model is trained and evaluated using the CICDDoS2019 dataset, which offers a comprehensive range of DDoS attacks for improved analysis. By leveraging DL techniques, DDoSNet achieves superior performance in detecting network attacks compared to conventional ML approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Results and Discussion:\n",
            "Evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, demonstrate the effectiveness of DDoSNet in identifying DDoS attacks with high confidence. The model outperforms classical ML algorithms such as Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression, indicating its potential for enhancing network security. Further research may explore multi-class classification frameworks and diverse datasets to strengthen anomaly detection capabilities in SDN environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion and Future Work:\n",
            "DDoSNet presents a promising solution for detecting DDoS attacks in SDN networks using DL techniques. The model shows significant improvements in attack detection accuracy, highlighting its potential for enhancing network security. Future work may focus on expanding the model's capabilities to classify specific attack types and simulate diverse network environments for comprehensive evaluation.\n"

Artificial neural networks, or ANNs, consist of layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that process and learn from input data. In a fully connected deep neural network, there are input and hidden layers linked sequentially. Neurons in each layer receive input from the previous layer or the input layer, passing it on to the next layer until the final output is generated. Through nonlinear transformations, these layers allow the network to learn complex representations of the input data.\n",
